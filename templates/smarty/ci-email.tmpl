Hi, you've got this e-mail as the author ({$commitInfo.an}) of commit {$currentRevShort} to branch {$branchName}.
It looks like there are problems in file(s) modified since previous revision {$oldRevShort}:

{if $fileErrors}
{include file="include-lint-errors-list.tmpl" fileList=$fileErrors revision=$currentRev}
{/if}

<p>If the problems above are real, you can fix them.
If these warnings are from code merged from other branch and not result of merge conflict, you can ignore them or find the author of the original commit.
If the report is wrong, you can help <a href='mailto:gariev@hotmail.com?subject=xref'>improve XRef CI</a> itself and/or ignore this e-mail.
</p>
